# Common Core Ontologies
This repository contains the Common Core Ontologies (CCO), which comprise eleven ontologies containing classes and relations that serve as a mid-level reference for integrating data across any domain. CCO extends from the Basic Formal Ontology (BFO), a ISO standard top-level ontology [ISO/IEC 21838â€‘1](https://www.iso.org/standard/71954.html). BFO is [widely]() used across the U.S. Government, the biomedical domain, an in industry. Both BFO and CCO have been endorsed by Chief Data Officers within the U.S. Department of Defense and Intelligence Community as baseline ontology standards. <<< TODO: add links

The Common Core Governance Board (CCGB) was founded in December of 2023 to ensure that CCO is maintained in perpetuity and independent of any particular individual, organization, or influence. <<< TODO: Link
